# TweetClipper

A Twitter Bot for Generating Memeable Clips

## Overview
TweetClipper generates memeable clips from videos on Twitter. It combines the video and tweet to create a new clip that can be easily shared on social media platforms.

The project consists of a Twitter bot that responds to users that mention it under a tweet that has a video or animated gif attachment. It also includes a front-end webpage where users can submit the link to the tweet they want to use, and a back-end that processes requests from the front-end.

## Usage
There are two ways to use TweetClipper:

### Twitter Bot
To use the twitter bot just go on twitter and mentions [@tweet_clipper]() under the tweet you like to capture as video.

### Webpage
Go to the [webpage]() and paste the link to the tweet you want to use.
Click the "Generate Clip" button.
The back-end webapp will process the request and generate a memeable clip from the video and tweet.
The clip can be downloaded and shared on social media platforms.
